## Vehicle Selector  

This Shiny App uses the mtcars dataset.

The table on the right shows cars that match the search criteria on the left. On the left you can use sliders to limit your search by ranges for:

1) mpg  
2) HP  
3) Displacement  

And then by selecting:  

4) Transmission Type  
5) Number of Cylinders  

Matching vehicles from the mtcars dataset will automatically appear on the right.
